## Experience

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for developing and optimizing core features. Currently, I am contributing to the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) at FACTIVITY, where I collaborate with internal and external development teams to design, implement, and test software solutions. My skills include Flask, Progress 4GL, ABL, .NET Framework, OpenEdge, Unix, Windows Batch Scripting, SQL, and React.js.

I also have experience as a Research Assistant at Cleveland State University, conducting research and implementing Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) using GPU-based systems to enhance performance and explore advancements in secure computing technologies. My skills in this role include Powershell, Figma, programming in C and Python.

As a Cloud Engineering Intern at Trek10, Inc., I participated in the Launch Program, where I was trained on AWS services and later worked on open-source projects. I developed skills in Databases, Gitlab, Powershell, Programming, Agile Methodologies, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and AWS CloudFormation.

Additionally, I served as an Engineering Peer Teacher at Cleveland State University, providing assistance in Introduction to Computing (Java) and Introduction to Programming (Java). My skills in this role include JavaScript, Powershell, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
